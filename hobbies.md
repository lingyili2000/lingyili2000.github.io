<br>There must be **something truly magical** about practicing calligraphy, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. I also really enjoyed visiting some of the museum's calligraphy exhibitions.


## Swimming & Surfing

<br>Hiking removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the mountains.
